The scripts in this package simplify the process of creating an ad-hoc `Hadoop` cluster on the `EC2`, using a pre-built `AMI`.

To use the tools in this package:

Copy the file ``conf/settings.template`` to ``conf/settings`` and set the variables in it correctly.

Run:

::

        bin/cloud launch

to start a cluster with the number of instances specified in the settings file.
Once the cluster starts, run:

::

        bin/cloud login

to login to the master node.
Once you are finished, run:

::

        bin/cloud terminate

to terminate the cluster.

See the manual under ``doc/`` for more information.
